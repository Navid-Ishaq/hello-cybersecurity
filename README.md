# hello-cybersecurity
A foundational space for experimenting with cybersecurity labs, multi-cloud defense strategies, and real-world threat detection using Microsoft Defender XDR, Sentinel, and other cloud security tools including AWS and Google Cloud.

# 👋 Hello Cybersecurity

Welcome to my foundational cybersecurity lab and learning space!  
This repository captures my journey through hands-on experiments in:

- 🔐 Threat Detection
- ☁️ Cloud Security
- 🎯 SOC Operations
- 🛡️ Microsoft Defender XDR
- 📡 Sentinel & Threat Intelligence

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To build a personal lab for exploring real-world attack scenarios, practicing incident response, and mastering multi-cloud security operations across Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud platforms.

---

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Identity, Cloud
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM + SOAR)
- Microsoft Entra (Identity & Access)
- Azure Security Center
- GitHub Actions for automation
- AWS Security Hub (coming soon)
- Google Chronicle Security (planned)
